# Conway Synth
Synthesizer based on Conway's Game of Life
Trying to avoid step sequencer fashions that have been done before and basing it on actual cell generation

## Why JS?
I started in Python, brew and pip weren't being friendly to one another, and I really wanted to get this underway before the momentum slowed. Furthermore, I'm more familiar with `tone.js`, which seemed to be better documented and easier to use than Python's `pyo`

## To Run
To currently run this project:
- ???

To run the depricated  Python code:
- Run `main.py`
- Click any boxes for the initial condition
- Press `return` to start the game
